TODO:
    Users:
Will profile picture always be a link with a .com? Add error checking then

    Reviews:
Check that '$pull' is done correctly in remove
Kind of last minute I changed the reviews in courses to not just be an ID so that it was easier to calculate the overall rating for the course, check to see if that works

    Courses: 
Discuss section and its purpose

    Groups:
Do we need multiple 'get all' functions for the corresponding courseId's
MAKE SURE THE GET ALL BY COURSES ACTUALLY WORKS!!!
Do we have to make sure that the department is still the same? if so we have to add the department to the data functions - MAIN FEATURE SO WE HAVE TO DECIDE!!!

    Comments:
Everything looks good I think
Not doing update, probably?


Overall:
Scheudling - Where would that go? is that a data function (probably is)

Extra: would have add friends to users and requests/outgoing requests or something
analytics would have to be added as well

For stevens registration : should we create another collection for verifying student's email address during registration?
